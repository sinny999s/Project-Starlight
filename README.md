# Project-Starlight
This multitool was created for educational purposes. One specific tool was solely for testing DDoS attacks on my own websites in a controlled manner, with the aim of studying and enhancing cybersecurity defenses. I emphasize that this was done responsibly and solely for learning and mitigation purposes.


This multitool has been designed to aid educational exploration and testing of server IP configurations and defenses. It can simulate various scenarios, including controlled network tests for security learning purposes, aimed at understanding vulnerabilities and improving defensive measures.
